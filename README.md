var randomNumber = 0

for _ in numbers {
    randomNumber += 1
}
print("Here are the numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive")
```
## Question 2

``` 
let allNumbers = 142..<159
var number = 0

for _ in allNumbers {
    number += 1
}
print("Here are the numbers from 142 to 159, exclusive")
```

## Question 3

```
let someRange = 15...80

for aNumberThatIsEven in someRange
    where aNumberThatIsEven % 2 == 0
    {
    print(aNumberThatIsEven)
}
```
## Question 4

Write code that prints only the odd numbers from 19 to 51, **inclusive.**
```
let someRange = 19...51

for aNumberThatIsOdd in someRange 
    where aNumberThatIsOdd % 2 != 0
    {
    print(aNumberThatIsOdd)
}
```
## Question 5

Write code that prints all the numbers that end in a **5** from 1 to 100, **exclusive.**

```
let someRange = 1..<100

for number in someRange
    where number % 5 == 0 && number % 2 != 0
    {
    print(number)
}
```
## Question 6

```
let someRange = 1...40

for number in someRange 
    where number % 10 == 7
    {
    print(number)
}




```
## Question 7

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

Numbers that are divisible by 3
```
let someRange = 20...150

 for number in someRange
    where number % 3 == 0
    {  
    print(number)
}
```



***
## Question 8

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that are divisible by 2 and 3`
```
let range = 20...150

for numDivis in range
    where numDivis % 2 == 0 && numDivis % 3 == 0
    
    {
    print(numDivis)
}
```
***
## Question 9

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that end with a 4`

```
let someRange = 20...150

for number in someRange 
where number % 10 == 4
{
print(number)
}
```



## Question 10

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Print out numbers: 31, 35, 40 to 60.`
```
for i in 20...150 {
if ( i == 31 || i == 35 || ( i >= 40  &&  i <= 60 )) {
    print ( i )
}
}
```

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

```
It would be an infinite loop because it remains true with no terminating condition```
```
***
```
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i < 9) {
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5


while (i...1005) {
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

for evenNumber in (i...1005) where evenNumber % 2 == 0 {
print(evenNumber)

i += 1
}



```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
The two while loops are presented in different order but the information inside and outside the brackets are the same and their outputs will be the same.

***
## Question 16

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

A break is used to immediately end a loop and continue tells a loop to stop based on certain conditions and go back to the start.  

***
## Question 17

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

8, 9, 10
***
## Question 18

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

4, 5, 6, 7
***
## Question 19

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```
1,1
2,1
3,1


***
## Question 20

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.
```
for x in 0...10 {
    for y in 0...10 {
            print("\(x),  \(y)")
            }
        }
```
***
## Question 21

```for x in 0...10 {
    for y in 0...10 {
        if ( x - y >= 5){
            print("\(x),  \(y)")
            }
        }
    }
```


Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 22

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:

```
Input `var N = 5`



Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

```
var N = 5

for i in 1...N {

print(i*i)

}
```
***
## Question 23

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
